    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will be needing a lot of AWS. Following the instructions\n",
    "below to set up your account and claim the free credit that is\n",
    "avaliable to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create an AWS account\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You may sign in using your existing Amazon account or you can create\n",
    "  a new account by selecting **Create a free account** using the\n",
    "  button at the right, then selecting **I am a new user**.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Enter your contact information and confirm your acceptance of the\n",
    "  AWS Customer Agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have created an Amazon Web Services Account, you may need\n",
    "  to accept a telephone call to verify your identity. Some people have\n",
    "  used Google Voice successfully if you don't have or don't want to\n",
    "  give a mobile number.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Once you have an account, go to\n",
    "  [http://aws.amazon.com/](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign in. You\n",
    "  will work primarily from the Amazon Management Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create Security Credentials.  Go to the [AWS security credentials\n",
    "  page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential).\n",
    "  If you are asked about IAM users, close the message.  Expand\n",
    "  **Access Keys** and click **Create New Access Key**.  You will see a\n",
    "  message **Your access key (access key ID and secret access key) has\n",
    "  been created successfully**. Click **Download Key File** and save it\n",
    "  to your home directory. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Remember where this file is. It contains the **Access Key ID** and\n",
    "  **Secret Access Key**. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 2: Set up an EC2 key pair\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to an Amazon EC2 instances, you need to create an **SSH key pair**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- After setting up your account, go to the <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose **N.Virginia** as your region. Do not use a different region.\n",
    "  *N. Virginia* is the default. Using a different region will require\n",
    "  configuration to work correctly.\n",

    "    \n",
    "- Download and save the `.pem` private key file to a new folder `.ssh`\n",
    "  in your home directory. Any folder that starts with a `.` will be\n",
    "  hidden in the folder. In this case, you want to hide the sensitive\n",
    "  information. \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Change the permissions of the file using this command: \n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  $ chmod 600 </path/to/saved/keypair/file.pem>\n",

    "### Step 3: Activate your AWS free credit\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Galvanize member, you are entitled to free AWS credits. Follow\n",
    "the steps below to activate your credits. They will come in about two\n",
    "weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to <http://aws.amazon.com/activate/portfolio-signup/> and fill in\n",
    "your details. Make sure the email you fill in is the one you have\n",

    "Part 1: S3 on AWS\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 is the strorage system on AWS. Next you will practice interacting\n",
    "with it through the Amazon GUI and with the Python library `boto`. You\n",
    "should know how to read and write files to S3 using a Python script at\n",
    "the end of this exercise.\n",

    "- Calculate the frequencies of all the words in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word frequencies are frequently used to group similar documents\n",
    "  together. For example, news stories about the same subject will tend\n",
    "  to have similar word frequencies.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Print out the 20 most frequently used words and their frequencies.\n",
