1. What are the four communication patterns of distributed systems?
<<<<<<< HEAD

    None
    All-to-one
    One-to-all
    All-to-all
    
2. Which of those four puts the most strain on the network? 

    All-to-all
    
3. Which of the following is *not* provided by the batch and serving layers:
	1. Debuggability
	2. Extensibility
	3. Ad hoc queries  
	4. Generalization
	5. Fault-tolerance
	6. Low-latency updates <-------
	7. Scalability
	8. Minimal maintenance
    
4. Which of the following is false about recomputation algorithms?
	1. Complexity of the algorithm is addressed during precomputation, 
        resulting in simple batch views and low-latency, on-the-fly processing
        
	2. They are extremely tolerant of human errors (compared to incremental algorithms)
    
	3. They require less computational resources but may generate much larger batch views (than incremental algorithms) <-----------------
