Individually
------------
Consider an app or website you use frequently. 
1. Think of all the actions you can take on that site/app (*e.g.* create an account, link to something or someone, send currency, etc.) List at least ten. 

Amazon

2. If you were a business analyst at that company, what are some questions you might like to have the answers to (*e.g.* how many individuals visited the site last month, how many people opened an account yesterday, etc.)










In Pairs
------------
Pick one of the two sites/apps and do the following:
1. Identify the raw, immutable, and atomic "facts" that you might like to capture for such a system. (*e.g.* Susan was born April 3, 1982. John lives in San Francisco, CA. April sent \$120 to Lucy on August 24, 2015.)
2. Describe a (normalized) relational data model for this business that answers the questions posed in the first section and also allows the most flexibility for asking new questions.
